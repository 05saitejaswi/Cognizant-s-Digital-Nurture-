A fox passed by a grapevine winding around the branches of a tree.He saw a bunch of grapes hanging above.He jumped to snatch some grapes.But the grapes were too high for him."You have to grow up fox," said a monkey living on the tree;"here take some grapes." The monkey shook
 the branch and a few grapes fell out.The fox caught them neatly in his mouth. "Are they sweet?" asked the monkey.
